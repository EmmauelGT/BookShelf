In order to test this web app in your local machine (specieally if your using VS Code to open the folder) you gotta start python's virtual environment using this command:
python -m venv venv

Then after it is created you have tu activate it.

Finally you use "Flask run" on  the terminal to start the proyect.

Thanks for reading.
